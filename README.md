## **Description**

I have a youtube channel with over 130k views and 500 subscribers. In my channel I post instrumental tracks that I compose for artists to write their own lyrics, and release songs if they have purchased the lease for it. I make music as a hobby for about 4 years now, but releasing them and collaborating with new artists from all around the globe is a fairly new thing for me. I decided to make my data science project about a general analysis of my channel & my music.

## **Motivation**

### **Why Am I Working on This Project?**

**Personal and Professional Development:**

- **Channel Growth:** To understand the factors influencing my YouTube channel's performance, aiming to increase views, likes, and overall engagement.
- **Content Optimization:** By analyzing the relationship between my effort and audience response, I can modify my content strategy for better results.
- **Data Science Application:** This project allows me to apply data analysis techniques to a real-world scenario.

**Creative Ideas:**

- **Effort Evaluation:** Quantify the effort put into each track (e.g., hours spent, complexity) to see how it correlates with audience engagement.
- **Predicting Stuff:** Analyze how different parameters affect others. (For example I have observed that when a view time for a video spikes considerably more than the views for the same video that I made, it means that an artist is writing lyrics and most likely will purchase a lease for the instrumental in the following weeks.)

## **Data Source**

### **Where Did I Get This Data? How Did I Collect It?**

**YouTube Analytics:**

- **Platform Data:** Utilized YouTube Studio's analytics to collect data on views, likes, comments, watch time, audience retention, and demographic information.
- **Data Export:** Used the export function to download data for each video in CSV format for detailed analysis.

**FL Studio:**

- **Time Tracking:** Logged the number of time spent composing each track.

**Other Sources:**

- **VidIQ:** Collected information about how i compared with competitors from the same niche.
- **SocialBlade:** Gathered general data about my channels performance
- **Shopify, Spotify, Soundcloud:** Gathered general data about the tracks that were released or leases that were purchased from my instrumentals.

## **Data Analysis**

These are planned analysis' for the project.

### **Engagement Patterns Over Time**

I analyzed my YouTube channel's activity to identify any patterns in viewer engagement. By examining the days of the week and times of day when my videos receive the most views and interactions, I compared different periods to see if there's a significant difference. This also helped me understand how these patterns align with global audience behavior.

### **Effort Invested vs. Views and Likes**

To understand how the effort I put into each track affects its performance, I looked at the time spent composing each instrumental (logged from FL Studio) and compared it to the number of views and likes each video received. This helped me see if there's a correlation between the time investment of a track and audience engagement.

### **Predicting Lease Purchases from Watch Time**

I observed that when a video's watch time increases without a corresponding spike in views, it might indicate that an artist is repeatedly listening to the track while writing lyrics. I analyzed these instances to see if there's a pattern that could help predict when a lease purchase is likely to occur in the following weeks.

### **Comparative Analysis with Competitors**

Using data from VidIQ and SocialBlade, I compared my channel's performance with other channels in the same niche. I looked at metrics such as views, subscriber growth, and engagement rates to see where I stand in the market and to identify areas for improvement.
